# Convex_Optimization_Integer_Programming
The goal of this project was to model some real-life problems into integer programming problems with linear objective and linear constraints and then solve them using various algorithms such as Branch and Bound, Cutting Planes, Branch and Cut and then compare the performances of these algorithms.
